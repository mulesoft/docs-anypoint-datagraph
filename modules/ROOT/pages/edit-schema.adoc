= Edit Your API Schema for Addition to the Unified Schema

When adding a new API to your unified schema you must make sure that none of the types of your current schema create a conflict with the existing types in your unified schema.

Because each type in the unified schema must be unique, each time you add a new API to your unified schema, you must edit your schemaâ€™s types before adding them to your unified schema.

Every time you add a new schema, ensure that you address the following tasks:

* Resolve any conflicts between object types
+
If there are types that have a conflict with the unified schema, make sure to resolve them all. See xref:resolve-conflicts.adoc[] for more information.
* Enable collaboration on an object type
+
Enable collaboration for applicable types and provide the required settings. This step is optional, but when you enable collaboration on types, you'll create a more connected and enriched unified schema. See xref:collaboration.adoc[] for more information.
* Manage visibility of schema elements
+
You can hide the fields, types, or query methods that you don't want to have visible in the unified schema. See xref:manage-elements-visibility.adoc[] for more information.
* Review and edit names of schema elements
+
You can review or change the names of all fields, types, and query methods that you are adding to the unified schema. See xref:edit-elements-names.adoc[] for more information.
* Merge similar object types
+
Merging types enables you to combine similar types to extend their fields and datasets for a more enriched query result. See xref:merge-types.adoc[] for more information.
* Link related fields between object types
+
Linking enables you to join related fields from two types for a more enriched query result.
See xref:linking.adoc[] for more information.
