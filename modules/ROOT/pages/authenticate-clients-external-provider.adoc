= Authenticate your Client Application Using an External Client Provider

API Manager enables you to configure different client providers for each one of your environments. Depending on the environment where your data graph runs, your client applications might need to authenticate using either the default Anypoint Platform native client provider or any of the supported external client providers.

If you don't configure any specific client provider for an environment, Anypoint Platform uses its default and native client provider.

You can configure the following providers:

* Default Anypoint Platform client provider
* Supported external OAuth providers: +
To configure client management on Anypoint Platform for these providers, you must have an IdP account. See https://docs.mulesoft.com/access-management/managing-api-clients[About Client Management^] for more information.
** OpenAM version: 14
** PingFederate versions: 6 through 8
** Dynamic Client Registration-compliant identity providers
+
Dynamic Client Registration-compliant identity providers must conform to the https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html[OpenID Connect Client Registration 1.0 incorporating errata set 1^].

When your environment uses a custom client provider, the *Request access* pop-up shows the required and optional fields defined in the external client provider implementation.

For example, when querying the `/api-federation/xapi/organizations/{organizationID}/environments/{environmentID}/type/federation/api/clientProvider/` endpoint, returns the configured grant types for that environment:

{
    "id": "aaaaaaaa-1a1a-1a1a-1a1a-aaaa1111aaa1",
    "name": "OpenAM",
    "typeName": "openam",
    "grantTypes": [
        {
            "name": "password",
            "label": "Resource Owner Grant",
            "depends": [],
            "exclude": [],
            "required": true //<1>
        },
        {
            "name": "implicit",
            "label": "Implicit Grant",
            "depends": [],
            "exclude": [],
            "required": true //<1>
        },
        {
            "name": "client_credentials",
            "label": "Client Credentials Grant",
            "depends": [],
            "exclude": [
                "authorization_code" //<2>
            ],
            "required": false
        },
        {
            "name": "authorization_code",
            "label": "Authorization Code Grant",
            "depends": [],
            "exclude": [
                "client_credentials" //<2>
            ],
            "required": false
        }
    ]
}

Those grant types properties are reflected in the UI when configuring access for a client:

<1> Both *Resource Owner Grant* and *Implicit Grant* are marked as required in the UI.
<1> Both *Client Credentials Grant* and *Authorization Code Grant* are mutually exclusive in the UI.
