= Anypoint DataGraph Hosting Options and Networking

Anypoint DataGraph supports the following Anypoint Platform hosting options and network configurations.

=== Supported Control Plane Hosting Options

Anypoint DataGraph is available for US and EU clouds control plane hosting.

=== Supported Runtime Plane Hosting Options

Anypoint DataGraph must connect to the destination URL you provide when adding an API to the unified schema. You don't need to make any extra configurations on your runtime plane if you meet any of the following scenarios:

* Your API implementations run on CloudHub.
* Your API implementations run on standalone instances and are connected to an Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC).
* Your API implementations run on any runtime plane hosting option and are public.

If your API instances run on standalone instances, are not public, and are not connected to Anypoint VPC, you must first pair your standalone runtimes to Anypoint VPC. See https://docs.mulesoft.com/runtime-manager/to-request-vpc-connectivity[Request Anypoint VPC Connectivity to Your Network^] for more information.

== Architecture and Networking

Anypoint DataGraph is a fully managed service that runs on Anypoint Platform.

Consumer requests from the public internet are routed to DataGraph through Shared or Dedicated load balancers, depending on your CloudHub or Anypoint Virtual Private Cloud (Anypoint VPC) configuration. DataGraph sends requests to the underlying APIs that make up the unified schema. Similarly, when you make changes in the DataGraph UI, those changes trigger updates of DataGraph in the Runtime Plane.

If you don’t have Anypoint VPC or if you’re unable to use ports 8081 and 8082 on a Shared Load Balancer, you need to specify new ports for DataGraph to use. Refer to (*link coming soon*) for instructions.
