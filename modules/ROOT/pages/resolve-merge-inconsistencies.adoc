= Resolve Merge Inconsistencies

Resolve inconsistencies across the fields before merging by either renaming or hiding the highlighted fields.

== Hide Types and Query Methods

You can hide the fields, types or query methods that you don't want to have visible in the unified schema. The fields, types, or query methods that you hide make them unavailable for querying.

== Rename a type

Rename a type, query method, or a field to avoid conflicting with your target type.
