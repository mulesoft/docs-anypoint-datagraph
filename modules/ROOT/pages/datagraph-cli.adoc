= Anypoint DataGraph CLI Reference
:page-aliases: datagraph-cli-errors.adoc
 
Anypoint Platform provides a command-line interface (CLI) for DataGraph. The CLI supports both the interactive shell and standard CLI modes. 

Use the DataGraph CLI to manage:

* <<datagraph-api-sources>>
* <<datagraph-load-balancers>>

== Before You Get Started 

* Review xref:overview-cli-extensions.adoc[Using the DataGraph CLI and API Extensions] before using the CLI to add API sources to DataGraph.
* Review xref:3.x@anypoint-cli::index.adoc[Anypoint CLI prerequisites, installation, and authentication instructions].

== DataGraph CLI Command Errors

DataGraph returns these errors when you incorrectly define a command. These errors can be caused by an incorrect option 
parameter, an ID that cannot be found, or the lack of a required option.

* xref:options-are-required[Options are Required]
* xref:not-found[Not Found]
* xref:bad-request[Bad Request]
* xref:api=already-exists[API Already Exists]
* xref:no-api-instances-found[No API Instances Found]
* xref:must-define-url[Must Define URL]
* xref:invalid-api-calls[Invalid API Calls]
* xref:unauthorized[Unauthorized]
* xref:api-not-found-in-current-evironment[API Not Found in Current Environment]

=== Options are Required

Output:
----
{
  "error": {
    "errorMessage": "Options are required"
  }
}
----

Cause:

This error indicates that at least one option is required to run the command.

* `datagraph sources add`: Either the `--url` option or the `--discover-url` option is required for this command.
* `datagraph sources update/promote`: Any available option is required. Define an element to update or promote in the target source.

=== Not Found

Output:
----
{
  "errorCode": "dg-xapi-proxy",
  "errorMessage": "Not Found"
}
----

Cause:

This error indicates that DataGraph didn't find the asset.

* `datagraph sources add`: The asset is not reachable either because the group ID, asset ID, and version ID does not correspond to a valid asset, or you cannot access the asset.
* `datagraph sources update/promote`: The UUID you provided does not exist in the current environment or in the target environment to which you're attempting to promote the asset.

=== Bad Request

Output:
----
{
  "error": {
    "code": "400",
    "message": "Bad Request"
  }
}
----

Cause:  

This error indicates that some required parameters in the command are incorrectly formatted.

* `datagraph sources update`: The provided source ID is not a valid UUID.
* `datagraph sources promote`: The source ID or the target environment ID are not in a valid UUID format.

=== API Already Exists

Output:
----
{
  "errorCode": "dg-federation-source-exists",
  "errorMessage": "API already exists"
}
----

Cause:

This error indicates that the API you are trying to add already exists in the unified schema.

* `datagraph sources add`: The asset ID and major version of the API source already exist in the unified schema. To make changes to the source, use the `datagraph sources update` command.

=== No API Instances Found

Output:
----
{
  "errorCode": "dg-xapi-no-api-instances",
  "errorMessage": "No API instances found"
}
----

Cause:

This error indicates the lack of URL to retrieve for an API instance.

* `datagraph sources add/update/promote`: This errors appears when using the ``--discover-url` option. It occurs when the asset has no valid instances from which the URL can be retrieved that arenâ€™t from a mocking service. In such cases, use the `--url` option instead.

=== Must Define URL

Output:
----
{
  "error": {
    "errorMessage": "Must define url or set --discover-url"
  }
}
----

Cause:

This error indicates that you must set the URL using either `--url` or `--discover-url`.

* `datagraph sources add`: Because an URL is a required field in the `add` command, you must set one of the two options, `--url` or `--discover-url`.

=== Invalid API Calls

Output:
----
{
  "errorCode": "dg-xapi-invalid-api-calls",
  "errorMessage": "Invalid Api Calls: 1500"
}
----

Cause:

This error indicates that you requested an invalid number of API calls.

* `datagraph scale`: The number of concurrent calls must be a number between 1 and 1200.

=== Unauthorized

Output:
----
{
  "error": {
    "code": "401",
    "message": "Unauthorized"
  }
}
----

Cause: 

This error indicates that you lost the session in the CLI when using it in interactive mode. Exit and relaunch the CLI, and then log in again.

=== API Not Found in Current Environment

Output:
----
{
  "errorCode": "dg-federation-source-not-in-env",
  "errorMessage": "API not found in current environment"
}
----

Cause:

This error indicates that the API source you are trying to edit, delete, or update exists, but it is not in the working environment.

* `datagraph sources update/promote`: The UUID sent is not in the working environment. Or, if you are using the `--version` option, the major version is not compatible with the current version.

== DataGraph CLI Validation Errors

DataGraph returns these errors when you use the `datagraph validate asset` command before adding or updating an API source against the unified schema.

* xref:editing-errors[Editing Errors]
* xref:conflict-errors[Conflict Errors]

=== Editing Errors

Editing errors are generated when the edits in the particular API source contain a semantic problem. These errors use the code property `dg-federation-customization-conflict` and have the following structure:

----
{
  "code": "dg-federation-customization-conflict",
  "detail": [
    {
      "code": "element-not-found-in-spec",
      "editType": "set-primary-key",
      "reason": "field addId was not found in the specification",
      "element": "Address"
    }
  ],
  "message": "Customization conflict found adding Customer API"
}
----

* The `message` field contains a human-readable response of the validation and provides a summary of the error.
* The `detail` field contains a list of all the conflicts found in the current asset:
** The `code` field identifies the type of error.
** The `editType` field identifies the customization that has the conflict.
** The `reason` field contains a human-readable description of the issue.
** the `element` field contains the problem.

=== Conflict Errors

Conflict errors occur when you try to add an API schema to the unified schema. These errors use the code property `dg-federation-udg-conflict` and have the following structure:

----
{
  "code": "dg-federation-udg-conflict",
  "detail": [
    {
      "element": "Customer",
      "violations": [
        {
          "code": "incompatible-primary-key-set",
          "keys": [
            "customerId"
          ],
          "expectedKeys": [
            "name"
          ],
          "message": "Primary key set have edges with different names"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "message": "Merge conflict found adding CLI - Customer OAS API"
}
----

* The `message` field contains a human-readable response of the validation and provides a summary of the error.
* The `detail` field contains a list of all conflicts found when trying to merge the API schema into the unified schema. 
** The `element` field contains the location of the conflict.
** The `violations` field lists the conflicts to fix. 
*** The `code` field identifies the type of the error.
*** The `message` field contains a human-readable description of the issue, and, depending on the type of error, it can contain additional properties with more details.
