= Troubleshooting Query Performance with Query Tracing

Query tracing in Anypoint DataGraph helps you analyze query performance by tracing every call made to the source APIs of the unified schema for a given query.

Trace results provide the following information:

[calloutlist]
. Time taken by Anypoint DataGraph to parse and validate the query @1
. Total response time for the entire query
. Errors identified during query execution
. Lack of trace information, denoted by a fading line
. Duration of requests to each source API in the query
