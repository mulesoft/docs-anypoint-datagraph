= Troubleshooting Query Performance with Query Tracing

Query tracing in Anypoint DataGraph helps you analyze query performance by tracing every call made to the source APIs of the unified schema for a given query.

Trace results provide the following information:

<1> Time taken by Anypoint DataGraph to parse and validate the query
<2> Total response time for the entire query
<3> Errors identified during query execution
<4> Lack of trace information, denoted by a fading line
<5> Duration of requests to each source API in the query

== Prerequisites

You must have xref:permissions.adoc[the Contribute or Admin permission] to use query tracing.
