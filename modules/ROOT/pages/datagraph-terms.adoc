|===
|Term |Usage
|API schema |Generated by Anypoint DataGraph from your API specification in RAML or OAS, an API schema contains a collection of the GET resources and entities that you’ve defined in your API specification, and the relationships between them.
|Unified schema |The unified schema is a single, always-current collection of types from different API schemas that you’ve added to Anypoint DataGraph and made available for consumers to query.
|Object types |The most common type in a schema, object types represent entities in your API specification that are returned as part of a GET response.
|Enum types |An enum type returns only a specific set of values that you’ve defined in your API specification.
|Union types |Union types describe instances of data using other object types. A union type consists of one or more specific object types.
|Query types |A query type is the entrypoint to an API schema when you make a request. This type contains the query methods you’ve defined in your API specification.
|Query methods |Each unique GET endpoint defined in your API specification is represented by a query method, which you use to start a query.
|Fields |Fields are properties you define for an object type in your API specification.
|Level-1 types |In an API schema, Level-1 types are object types that can be directly returned by a query method.
|Nested types |In an API schema, you can access nested types only through the query methods of Level-1 types. Nested types are not directly returned by a query method.
|Collaboration |By enabling collaboration on Level-1 object types, you allow other types to link and merge with such types. Collaboration enables you to create a more connected unified schema so that your consumers can have a more efficient query experience.

Collaboration is possible only on Level-1 object types.
|Linking |Linking enables you to join fields from two related types that describe different objects to create a connection between them.
|Merging |Merging types enables you to combine similar types into a single type and extend their fields and datasets for an enriched query result.
