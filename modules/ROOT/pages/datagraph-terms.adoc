|===
|Term |Definition
|API schema |Generated by DataGraph from your API specification in RAML or OAS, an xref:schemas.adoc[API schema] contains a collection of the GET resources and entities, and the relationships between them, that you’ve defined in your API specification.
|Unified schema |The xref:index.adoc#the-unified-schema[unified schema] is a single, always current collection of types from different API schemas that you’ve added to DataGraph and made available for consumers to query.
|Object types |The most common type in a schema, xref:schemas.adoc#object-types-and-fields[object types] represent entities in your API specification that are returned as part of a GET response.
|Enum types |An xref:schemas.adoc#enum-types[enum type] returns only a specific set of values that you’ve defined in your API specification.
|Union types |xref:schemas.adoc#union-types[Union types] describe instances of data using other object types. A union type consists of one or more concrete object types.
|Query type |A xref:schemas.adoc#query-types[query type] is the entry point to your API schema or unified schema when you make a request. This type contains the query methods you’ve defined in your API specifications.
|Query method |Each unique GET endpoint defined in your API specification is represented by a xref:schemas.adoc#query-types[query method].
|Fields |xref:schemas.adoc#object-types-and-fields[Fields] are a set of properties you define for an object type in your API specification.
|Level 1 types |In an API schema, xref:schemas.adoc#level-1-nested-types[level 1 types] are directly returned by a query method.
|Nested types |In an API schema, you can only access xref:schemas.adoc#level-1-nested-types[nested types] through the query methods of level 1 types. Nested types are not directly returned by a query method.
|Collaboration |By enabling xref:collaboration.adoc[collaboration] on level 1 object types, you allow other types to link and merge with such types. Collaboration allows you to create a more connected unified schema so that your consumers can have a more efficient query experience.

Collaboration is only possible on level 1 object types.
|Linking |xref:linking.adoc[Linking] allows you to join fields from two related types that describe different objects to create a connection between them.
|Merging |xref:merge-types.adoc[Merging] types enables you to combine similar types into a single type and extend their fields and datasets for a more enriched query result.
