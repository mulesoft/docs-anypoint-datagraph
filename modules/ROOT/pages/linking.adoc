= Link Related Types

You can link your current type to a different target type to improve the query experience. Linking enables you to join fields from two related types, resulting in a more enriched query result.

You can link your current type to a target type if your current type is not collaboration enabled; however, the target must be collaboration enabled. See xref:collaboration.adoc[] for more information about how collaboration works.

For example, consider two API schemas, one with the object type `Order` and the other with the object type `Customer`:

[%header,%autowidth.spread,cols="a,a"]
|===
| Order Schema | Customer Schema
|
[source]
--
ordersByOrderId (orderId:String!):Order
--------------------
--------------------
Order
--------------------
orderId: String!
Items: Item[]
customerId: String!
--

|
[source]
--
customersByCustomerId (customerId:String!): Customer
--------------------
--------------------
Customer
--------------------
customerId: String!
name: String!
--

|===

Your unified schema currently looks like this:

.Unified Schema
[source]
--
ordersByOrderId (orderId:String!):Order
customersByCustomerId (customerId:String!): Customer
--------------------
--------------------
Order
--------------------
orderId: String!
Items: Item[]
customerId: String!
--------------------
--------------------
Customer
--------------------
customerId: String!
name: String!
--

In this current configuration, to query the order and the customer datasets at the same time, you must query both types separately:

.Query
[source]
--
ordersByOrderId (orderId: “123”) {
  orderId
  customerId
}
customersByCustomerId (customerId: “CC83”) {
  customerId
  name
}
--

Additionally, to query the customer data for the order, you must know the customer ID associated with it.

However, note that the `Order` object type has a field that returns `customerId`. You can link your `Order` object type to the `Customer` object type using customerId: String! as a foreign key, pointing to Customer as your target type, causing your selected foreign key to map to the primary key customerId:String! on `Customer` type.

As a result of this link:

* A new field called `Customer` is created in the `Order` object type that now returns the linked `Customer` object type.
* The new object type generated in your API schema acts as a reference to the type in the `Customer` API schema, ensuring that any changes made to the `Customer` API schema do not affect your `Order` API schema:
+
.Order Schema
[source]
--
ordersByOrderId (orderId:String!):Order
--------------------
--------------------
Order
--------------------
orderId: String!
Items: Item[]
customer: Customer
--------------------
--------------------
Customer
--------------------
--------------------
customerId: String!
--

In the updated unified schema, you can see that the `Order` type is linked to `Customer` type:

[source]
--
ordersByOrderId (orderId:String!):Order
--------------------
--------------------
Order
--------------------
orderId: String!
Items: Item[]
customer: Customer
--------------------
--------------------
Customer
--------------------
--------------------
customerId: String
name: String
--

After linking, consumers of your unified schema can query the `Order` dataset along with its related `Customer` dataset without having to know the associated `customerId`:

.Query
[source]
--
ordersByOrderId (orderId: “123”) {
  orderId
  customer {
    name
}
--

== How to Link Fields Between Object Types

Before linking fields between types, be sure to xref:manage-elements-visibility.adoc[set the fields to visible].

. In the API schema navigation, select the object type you want to link with a target type.
. Scroll to the *Link to another type* pane, and in *Select the type you want to link to (Target menu)*, select the target object that contains the fields you want to link with.
. Use the drop-down menu to select the field that will be the foreign key in the source.
. In *New field configurations*, review or edit the name for the linked field.
. (Optional) Hide the foreign key field from the unified schema.
+
The new field will return the type you're linking to, so it's safe to hide the foreign key.
