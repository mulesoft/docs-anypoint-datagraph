= Resolve Conflicts

When adding types to your unified schema you must make sure that none of the types that you are adding create a conflict with the existing types in your unified schema.

When you add an API schema that has a type name that already exists within your unified schema, the platform throws an error. You must resolve this error before continuing.
If you donâ€™t care about adding this particular type to the unified schema, you can choose to hide the field.

If you want to add this conflicting type to the unified schema you must either:

* Hide the Type or Query Method +
See xref:manage-elements-visibility.adoc[] for more information.
* Rename your type to avoid conflicting names +
See xref:edit-elements-names.adoc[] for more information.
* Merge your new type with the existing type of the same name +
See xref:merge-types.adoc[] for more information.
