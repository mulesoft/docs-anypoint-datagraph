= Query the Unified Schema

The unified schema resolves into a single GraphQL endpoint. To query the unified schema, you first request access (if applicable) and then write and run a GraphQL query in the query editor.

== Prerequisites

* You must have xref:permissions.adoc[the Consume, Contribute, or Admin permission] to use request access and run queries.
* API calls are limited to 5MB of uncompressed data per call.

== Request Access to Run A Query

. From the side navigation panel, or the top right corner, select *Run a Query*.
. In the *Request access to run queries* dialog, select how you want to get access to run your queries.
+
If you want to use an existing client application or client ID and secret pair, you can find them in Exchange. Open Exchange in a new tab, navigate to *My applications* and select an application from the list to find relevant information.
+
Choose one of the following options:

** *Use one of my existing applications*: Choose an existing client application from the list, and click Request Access.
** *Create a new application and use it immediately*: Click *Next*, provide an application name and an optional description and application URL, and click *Create and Request Access*.
** *I already have credentials...*: Click *Next*, provide an existing client ID and secret pair, and then click *Authenticate & Request Access*.
. To change your access method from the *Run Query* page, click *Manage Credentials* > *Switch credentials*.

== Write and Run a Query

. In the query editor, start typing your query using the in-line autocomplete function or type *Option/Alt + Shift + Space* to open the autocomplete menu.

+
Query Trace results for Anypoint DataGraph provide the following information:
+
* Time taken by DataGraph to parse and validate the query
* Total response time for the entire query
* Duration of requests to each source API in the query

. To see response logs associated with the query, click *View response logs*.
+

+
Log levels for Anypoint DataGraph include, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, and ERROR.
. Click *View History* to access this same query—or others—at a later time.
. To use this query in your application, click *Copy endpoint* to copy the query and the automatically generated GraphQL endpoint. You can also copy the query as a cURL snippet.
