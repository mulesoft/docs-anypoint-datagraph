= Removing APIs from the Unified Schema

You can remove APIs from the unified schema as needed. For example, remove an API to add a new version, or remove an API if the underlying REST API no longer exists.

However, be aware that when you remove an API from the unified schema, you break:

* Any merges and links with the types in the API schema that you remove
* Any existing queries that query the types and fields of the API schema that you remove

To remove an API:

. Click *List of APIs added* and select the API that you want to remove.
. Click *Remove API*, and then click *Apply Changes*.
