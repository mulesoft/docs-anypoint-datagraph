= Create and Edit Links Between Object Types

The following tasks explain how to create and undo links between object types.

== Link Related Object Types

Linking enables you to join fields from two related object types to create more useful query results from the unified schema.

* Before linking object types, be sure to xref:manage-elements-visibility.adoc[set the fields to visible].
* You can link only to object types that have xref:collaboration.adoc#enable-collaboration-on-an-object-type[Enable collaboration]for any object types you want to link to.

To link object types:

. In the API schema navigation, select the object type you want to link from (source).
. Scroll to the *Link to another type* pane, and in *Select the type you want to link to (Target menu)*, select the target object.
+
DataGraph will detect and display the primary key of the target type.

. Use the drop-down menu to select the field that will be the foreign key in the source.
+
The foreign key maps to the primary key on the target type and has the exact same data type.

. In *New field configurations*, review and edit, if necessary, the name for the linked field.
+
DataGraph creates this field in your current type and links it to the target type.
. (Optional) Hide the foreign key field from the unified schema.
+
The new field returns the type you're linking to, so it's safe to hide the foreign key unless it has outstanding queries.

. Click *Save changes*.

If you scroll up to the fields pane, an icon shows the fields are now linked:

== Remove a Link Between Object Types

A field can be linked to only one other object type at a time. So if you no longer need the link, or want to link the field to another object type, you can remove the original link.

To remove a linked between object types:

. From the unified schema, click *List of APIs added* and select the API that contains the object type with the linked field.
. In the API schema navigation, select the object type with the linked field, and scroll to the *Link to another type* pane.
. Find the link you want to remove and click *>* to open the link details.
. Click *Remove Link*.
. Click *Save*, and then click *Apply Changes*.
