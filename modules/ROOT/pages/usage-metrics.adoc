= Viewing Usage Metrics for Anypoint Datagraph

Anypoint DataGraph enables you to track metrics so you’re always aware of your usage relative to the limits specified for your business groups. Use these metrics to track the total number of downstream API calls made for each of the environments in which you’ve deployed a unified schema. 

Usage metrics are separated by Production and Sandbox environments per business group. More specifically, the metrics in any given environment show:

* API requests received for that environment
* API requests received for other environments of that type
* API requests received for all environments of that type
