= Retrieve a Copy of the Unified Schema

You can get a copy of the unified schema by using a third-party API client. 

To retrieve a copy of the unified schema, you need the following:

* The graph endpoint of your unified schema, which you can obtain from the homepage of Anypoint DataGraph.
* The `client_id` and `client_secret` you use to query the unified schema, which you can obtain from the xref:api-manager::datagraph-viewing-application-contracts.adoc[Client Applications page] in API Manager.

 
In the API client of your choice, run a GET request with the following information:

* The graph endpoint of the unified schema appended with `/schema`
* Your `client_id` and `client_secret` headers

For example:

----
curl https://<GRAPH_ENDPOINT>/schema \
-H 'client_id: <YOUR_CLIENT_ID>' \
-H 'client_secret: <YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>'
----
