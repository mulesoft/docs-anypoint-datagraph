= Promote an API Schema to Another Environment

As you develop your APIs, following software development lifecycle best practices, you can promote them through environments and add them to that environment's unified schema.

You can promote APIs to any environment for which you have permissions to contribute.

. Click *List of APIs added* and select the API that you want to promote.
. Click *Promote API*.
. From the *Target environment* list, select the target environment for promotion.
+
If this is the first time you're promoting the API, complete the following:
. Click *Next: Configure URL*.
* If your API is managed by API Manager or if you have added the APIâ€™s instances in Exchange, select *Get an existing URL from Anypoint Platform*.
* If you prefer to provide your own implementation URL, select *Add a new URL*. You can also click *Use the URL in API specification*. +
See xref:supported-hosting-options.adoc[] for more information about the supported runtime plane hosting options.
. Click *Next: Provide URL*.
. On the *Provide authentication* page, select the type of authentication on the GET endpoints for the API that you are adding. +
This allows the unified schema to make requests to your API when queried. +
