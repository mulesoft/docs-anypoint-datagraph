= Resolve Runtime Errors

When running queries against your unified schema, the UI might display a *Failed to fetch schema* error message:

image::failed-to-fetch-error.png[]

[source,JSON]
--
{
  "message": "Failed to fetch",
  "stack": "TypeError: Failed to fetch"
}
--

This error occurs either when:

* Anypoint Datagraph can't connect to your unified schema because you are hosting it behind a dedicated load balancer. +
To resolve this, ensure that your VPC is properly configured. See xref:hosting-options.adoc[Hosting Options and Networking] for more information.
* Your unified schema can't connect to its underlying APIs. +
To resolve this, ensure that your APIs are up and running.
